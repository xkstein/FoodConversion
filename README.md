# Volume to Weight Converter for Cooking
This is an experiment which tests an idea for the interface of a program which converts food measurements from volume to weight. I think it went pretty well, but it's still definitely just a prototype. I'll probably continue to flesh out the database to suit my needs and maybe I'll rewrite it at some point.

It's my first js project of this size and the code is a nightmare, but contributions to the code or database would be appreciated!

Most of the food densities are from [this](https://www.fao.org/docrep/017/ap815e/ap815e.pdf) database.
